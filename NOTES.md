# Notes

## Thoughts

- The purpose of this project is to use basic skills of Python programming to
build an educational program. This program touches on the basics of program
structure, conditional logic, abstraction, standard streams, exit codes, CSV
file format, and databases.
- SamQL is a made up language so it isn't formally described or backed up by
real world examples and usage. Hopefully the examples are a good way to
concretely describe what is expected and it is backed up by the README. If we
choose to expand SamQL into a larger scope later we may have to break some of
the decisions made so far.
- Development of this program can happen on any system that supports Python
development. Linux is recommended since this is a command-line program.
- Start by creating a script called `samql.py` and write all your program logic
there. Any time you wish to test your program to see if it runs as expected run
the `test.py` script. The test script will execute `samql.py` with different
queries then check that the stdout, stderr, and exit codes are expected. The
assignment is basicly done if you can get all of the tests to pass. However
since we are building a generic tool, you are free to add your own tables to
continue to develop and test your program.

## Recommendations

- Use Python 3.
- Use Linux instead of Windows. Windows can run Linux using WSL so you don't
need a new machine or VM.
- Use VSCode for development.
- Use Windows Terminal to navigate your Linux machine
- Use GIT as version control while developing your code.
